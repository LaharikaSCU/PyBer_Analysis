# Ride Sharing Analysis

Analyzing and visualizing ridesharing data with Python.

## Overview

Perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by types of cities in which Pyber operates. Creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for undeserved neighborhoods.

## Results
Below is the statistical summary of PyBers ride sharing Data

summary shows:
 - Urban cities have highest ridership demand and rural cities the lowest
 - Urban cities have ~4x drivers than suburban cities
 - Suburban cities have ~6x drivers than rural and ~5x revenue
 - Rural cities have highest avg fare per ride/driver
 
 ## Summary
 
 Based on analysis, my recommendations to PyBer are
   - increasing #drivers in rural areas to meet ride demand
   - change per mile price by city types, as trip distance might be less in urban as against rural
